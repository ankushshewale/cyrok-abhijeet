## Netlify configuration for Angular SSR app "cyrok"
## This aligns Netlify's publish directory with the Angular build output

[build]
  # Uses the default Angular build script
  command = "npm run build"

  # The Angular CLI outputs to "dist/cyrok", and the browser bundle lives in "dist/cyrok/browser"
  # This is where @netlify/angular-runtime expects the built app.
  publish = "dist/cyrok/browser"
